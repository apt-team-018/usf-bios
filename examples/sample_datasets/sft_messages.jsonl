However, always consult your doctor before making significant changes, especially if you're on medication."}]}

A regular computer would try one path at a time until it finds the exit. A quantum computer, however, can explore ALL paths simultaneously!\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n1. **Qubits vs Bits:**\n   - Regular computers use bits (0 or 1)\n   - Quantum computers use qubits (can be 0, 1, or BOTH at once)\n\n2. **Superposition:**\n   - A qubit can exist in multiple states simultaneously\n   - Like a coin spinning in the air - it's both heads AND tails until it lands\n\n3. **Entanglement:**\n   - Qubits can be connected so that changing one instantly affects another\n   - No matter how far apart they are!\n\n**Real-World Applications:**\n- Drug discovery (simulating molecules)\n- Cryptography (breaking and creating codes)\n- Weather prediction (processing massive data)\n- Financial modeling (optimizing portfolios)\n\n**Current Limitations:**\n- Requires extreme cold (-459°F)\n- Very sensitive to interference\n- Still in early development\n\nQuantum computers won't replace regular computers but will excel at specific complex problems."}]}
