Condensation**\n- Water vapor rises and cools in atmosphere\n- Forms clouds as tiny water droplets or ice crystals\n- Requires condensation nuclei (dust, pollen)\n\n**3. Precipitation**\n- Water droplets combine and grow heavy\n- Falls as rain, snow, sleet, or hail\n- Type depends on temperature\n\n**4. Collection**\n- Water gathers in oceans, lakes, rivers\n- Some infiltrates soil (groundwater)\n- Cycle repeats continuously\n\n**Fun fact:** The water you drink today could have been drunk by dinosaurs - it's the same water cycling for billions of years!"}], "label": true}
