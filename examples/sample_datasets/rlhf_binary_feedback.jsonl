{"prompt": "What is machine learning?", "completion": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence where computers learn patterns from data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for each task. It uses statistical techniques to enable systems to improve their performance on specific tasks through experience.", "label": true}
{"prompt": "What is machine learning?", "completion": "Machine learning is when computers think like humans.", "label": false}
{"prompt": "How do I make pasta?", "completion": "To make pasta:\n\n1. **Boil water** - Use a large pot with plenty of salted water (1 tbsp salt per 4 quarts)\n2. **Add pasta** - Once boiling, add pasta and stir immediately to prevent sticking\n3. **Cook al dente** - Follow package timing, usually 8-12 minutes. Taste test!\n4. **Save pasta water** - Reserve 1 cup before draining (starchy water helps sauce cling)\n5. **Drain and toss** - Drain pasta, return to pot, add sauce and toss\n\n**Pro tips:**\n- Don't add oil to water (prevents sauce adhesion)\n- Don't rinse pasta (removes starch)\n- Finish cooking pasta in the sauce for 1-2 minutes", "label": true}
{"prompt": "How do I make pasta?", "completion": "Just boil water and put pasta in it until it's soft.", "label": false}
{"prompt": "Explain photosynthesis.", "completion": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose.\n\n**The Equation:**\n6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂\n\n**Two Stages:**\n\n1. **Light-dependent reactions** (in thylakoids)\n   - Light is absorbed by chlorophyll\n   - Water molecules are split, releasing oxygen\n   - ATP and NADPH are produced\n\n2. **Light-independent reactions / Calvin Cycle** (in stroma)\n   - CO₂ is fixed into glucose using ATP and NADPH\n   - No direct light needed, but requires products from stage 1\n\n**Importance:**\n- Produces oxygen for respiration\n- Creates food/energy for almost all life on Earth\n- Removes CO₂ from atmosphere\n- Foundation of most food chains", "label": true}
{"prompt": "Explain photosynthesis.", "completion": "Plants use sunlight to make food. The green stuff in leaves does it.", "label": false}
{"prompt": "What are the benefits of regular exercise?", "completion": "Regular exercise provides numerous physical and mental health benefits:\n\n**Physical Benefits:**\n- Improves cardiovascular health and reduces heart disease risk\n- Strengthens muscles and bones, reducing osteoporosis risk\n- Helps maintain healthy weight through calorie burning\n- Boosts immune system function\n- Improves sleep quality\n- Increases energy levels and stamina\n- Reduces risk of type 2 diabetes\n\n**Mental Benefits:**\n- Releases endorphins, improving mood and reducing stress\n- Reduces symptoms of anxiety and depression\n- Improves cognitive function and memory\n- Boosts self-esteem and confidence\n- Provides social opportunities (group activities)\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Adults: 150 minutes moderate or 75 minutes vigorous activity weekly\n- Include strength training 2+ days per week\n- Break up sedentary time throughout the day", "label": true}
