Without it, we'd be at -0.4°F (-18°C)!\n\n**The Problem:**\nHuman activities (burning fossil fuels, deforestation) are adding extra greenhouse gases, trapping more heat than natural. This causes global warming and climate change.\n\n**Think of it this way:** A car in the sun gets hot because the windows let light in but trap the heat.
