{"prompt": "What are the symptoms of diabetes?", "chosen": "The main symptoms of diabetes include:\n\n1. **Increased thirst** (polydipsia) - feeling unusually thirsty\n2. **Frequent urination** (polyuria) - especially at night\n3. **Unexplained weight loss** - despite normal or increased appetite\n4. **Fatigue** - feeling tired and weak\n5. **Blurred vision** - due to fluid changes in eye lenses\n6. **Slow-healing sores** - cuts and wounds take longer to heal\n7. **Frequent infections** - skin, gum, or urinary infections\n\nType 1 diabetes symptoms often appear suddenly, while Type 2 symptoms develop gradually. If you experience these symptoms, consult a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis through blood glucose testing.", "rejected": "Diabetes symptoms are thirst and peeing a lot. You might lose weight too. Just check your sugar levels at home if you're worried."}
{"prompt": "How can I improve my sleep quality?",  "chosen": "Here are evidence-based strategies to improve sleep quality:\n\n**Sleep Hygiene:**\n- Maintain a consistent sleep schedule (same bedtime/wake time daily)\n- Create a cool, dark, quiet bedroom environment (65-68°F ideal)\n- Limit screen time 1-2 hours before bed (blue light disrupts melatonin)\n- Reserve the bed for sleep and intimacy only\n\n**Lifestyle Factors:**\n- Avoid caffeine after 2 PM\n- Limit alcohol (disrupts REM sleep)\n- Exercise regularly, but not within 3 hours of bedtime\n- Avoid large meals close to bedtime\n\n**Relaxation Techniques:**\n- Practice deep breathing or meditation\n- Try progressive muscle relaxation\n- Keep a worry journal to offload thoughts\n\n**If Problems Persist:**\n- Consider cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)\n- Consult a sleep specialist if issues last over 3 months\n- Rule out sleep disorders like sleep apnea\n\nMost adults need 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night.", "rejected": "Just try to sleep more and don't use your phone before bed. Maybe take some melatonin."}
{"prompt": "Explain the difference between machine learning and deep learning.", "chosen": "Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are related but distinct concepts:\n\n**Machine Learning:**\n- Subset of Artificial Intelligence\n- Algorithms learn patterns from data to make predictions\n- Requires manual feature engineering (humans identify important features)\n- Works well with smaller datasets\n- Examples: Linear regression, decision trees, random forests, SVM\n- Training is typically faster\n- More interpretable results\n\n**Deep Learning:**\n- Subset of Machine Learning\n- Uses neural networks with multiple layers (hence 'deep')\n- Automatic feature extraction (learns features on its own)\n- Requires large amounts of data to perform well\n- Examples: CNNs (images), RNNs/Transformers (text), GANs\n- Training requires significant computational power (GPUs/TPUs)\n- Often achieves state-of-the-art results but is less interpretable\n\n**When to Use Each:**\n- ML: Smaller datasets, need for interpretability, limited compute\n- DL: Large datasets, complex patterns (images, speech, text), sufficient compute\n\nDeep learning has revolutionized fields like computer vision and NLP, while traditional ML remains valuable for many business applications.", "rejected": "Deep learning is just a fancier version of machine learning that uses neural networks. They're basically the same thing."}
{"prompt": "What is the best way to learn a new programming language?", "chosen": "Here's a structured approach to effectively learn a new programming language:\n\n**1. Start with Fundamentals (Week 1-2)**\n- Understand syntax basics: variables, data types, operators\n- Learn control structures: if/else, loops, functions\n- Use official documentation and beginner tutorials\n- Set up a proper development environment\n\n**2. Practice with Small Projects (Week 3-4)**\n- Build simple programs: calculator, to-do list, quiz app\n- Solve coding challenges on LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codewars\n- Focus on understanding, not just copying code\n\n**3. Build Real Projects (Month 2+)**\n- Create projects that interest you personally\n- Contribute to open-source projects\n- Build a portfolio to showcase your work\n\n**4. Learn Best Practices**\n- Study design patterns relevant to the language\n- Learn testing frameworks\n- Understand version control (Git)\n- Read well-written code in the language\n\n**5. Engage with the Community**\n- Join Discord servers, Reddit communities, or forums\n- Attend meetups or conferences\n- Teach others what you learn (reinforces understanding)\n\n**Tips for Success:**\n- Code daily, even if just 30 minutes\n- Don't tutorial-hop; finish what you start\n- Debug actively; errors are learning opportunities\n- Build projects slightly beyond your comfort zone", "rejected": "Just watch YouTube tutorials and copy the code. You'll figure it out eventually."}
{"prompt": "How do vaccines work?", "chosen": "Vaccines work by training your immune system to recognize and fight specific pathogens without causing disease:\n\n**The Immune Response Process:**\n\n1. **Introduction of Antigen**\n   - Vaccines contain weakened/inactivated pathogens, or pieces of them (antigens)\n   - mRNA vaccines provide instructions for cells to make antigens\n\n2. **Immune System Activation**\n   - Antigen-presenting cells detect the foreign substance\n   - They alert T-cells (coordinators) and B-cells (antibody factories)\n\n3. **Antibody Production**\n   - B-cells create antibodies specific to the pathogen\n   - These antibodies can neutralize the actual pathogen if encountered\n\n4. **Memory Cell Formation**\n   - Some B and T cells become memory cells\n   - They remain in your body for years or decades\n   - Provide rapid response upon future exposure\n\n**Types of Vaccines:**\n- **Live-attenuated:** Weakened virus (MMR, chickenpox)\n- **Inactivated:** Killed pathogen (flu shot, polio)\n- **Subunit:** Pieces of pathogen (Hepatitis B, HPV)\n- **mRNA:** Genetic instructions (COVID-19 Pfizer/Moderna)\n- **Viral vector:** Modified virus delivers instructions (J&J COVID)\n\nVaccines undergo rigorous testing for safety and efficacy before approval.", "rejected": "Vaccines put a weak version of the virus in you so your body learns to fight it. Pretty simple really."}
