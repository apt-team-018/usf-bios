{"instruction": "Explain the concept of compound interest.", "input": "", "output": "Compound interest is interest calculated on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods.\n\n**Formula:** A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nWhere:\n- A = Final amount\n- P = Principal (initial investment)\n- r = Annual interest rate (decimal)\n- n = Number of times compounded per year\n- t = Time in years\n\n**Example:**\nInvest $1,000 at 5% annual interest compounded monthly for 10 years:\nA = 1000(1 + 0.05/12)^(12×10) = $1,647.01\n\nCompared to simple interest ($1,500), compound interest earns you an extra $147.01.\n\n**Key Insight:** The more frequently interest compounds, the more you earn. This is why Einstein allegedly called compound interest 'the eighth wonder of the world.'"}

{"instruction": "Summarize the key points of effective time management.", "input": "", "output": "**Effective Time Management Principles:**\n\n1. **Prioritize with Purpose**\n   - Use the Eisenhower Matrix (urgent/important)\n   - Focus on high-impact tasks first\n   - Learn to say 'no' to low-priority requests\n\n2. **Plan Strategically**\n   - Set SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)\n   - Plan your day the night before\n   - Block time for deep work\n\n3. **Eliminate Distractions**\n   - Turn off notifications during focus time\n   - Use website blockers if needed\n   - Create a dedicated workspace\n\n4. **Work Smarter**\n   - Batch similar tasks together\n   - Use the Pomodoro Technique (25 min work, 5 min break)\n   - Delegate when possible\n\n5. **Review and Adjust**\n   - Weekly review of accomplishments\n   - Identify time wasters\n   - Continuously optimize your system"}
{"instruction": "Convert the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.", "input": "Temperature: 25°C", "output": "To convert 25°C to Fahrenheit:\n\n**Formula:** F = (C × 9/5) + 32\n\n**Calculation:**\nF = (25 × 9/5) + 32\nF = (25 × 1.8) + 32\nF = 45 + 32\nF = **77°F**\n\nSo 25°C equals 77°F, which is a comfortable room temperature."}
{"instruction": "Explain the difference between REST and GraphQL APIs.", "input": "", "output": "**REST (Representational State Transfer):**\n- Uses multiple endpoints for different resources\n- Fixed data structure per endpoint\n- Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)\n- Can lead to over-fetching or under-fetching data\n- Well-established, widely adopted\n- Example: `GET /users/123`, `GET /users/123/posts`\n\n**GraphQL:**\n- Single endpoint for all queries\n- Client specifies exact data needed\n- Uses queries, mutations, and subscriptions\n- Eliminates over-fetching/under-fetching\n- Strongly typed schema\n- Example: `query { user(id: 123) { name, posts { title } } }`\n\n**When to Use:**\n- **REST:** Simple CRUD apps, caching important, team familiar with REST\n- **GraphQL:** Complex data relationships, mobile apps (bandwidth), rapid iteration\n\nBoth are valid choices; pick based on your project's needs."}
